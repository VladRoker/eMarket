# What is eMarket?

Once my friend asked me to make web application that would let him sell his goods in internet. Problem was - everyone would like to gain some profit, so my friend asked to do it in the only way he could afford it - free. For me that sounded like a way to start an open source project.
eMarket is free way to sell your goods over internet. It is disturbed over MIT license.
